![GIF Example](/Frontend-Test.gif "Example GIF")

Write a angular application in typescript with the follow requirements:

Create a web application that allows users to search for recipes and save them to a personal recipe collection. The application should include the following features:

- Use static JSON to retrieve a list of recipes
- Display the list item of recipes in card (contain name, recipes, images).
- Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for recipes by name, ingredients (Use reactive forms).
- Use a custom directive to highlight the recipe card when the user hovers over it.
- Allow users to save recipes to a personal recipe collection by clicking a "Save" button on each recipe card.
- Implement a "My Recipes" page that displays the user's saved recipes in a list.
- Allow users to remove recipes from their personal recipe collection by clicking a "Remove" button on each recipe in the "My Recipes" page.
- Implement loading and error states while retrieving the list of recipes from the API.
- In addition to the above requirements, the application should be designed with good coding practices in mind, such as separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.
- For search you cannot use button and you should update list by every change in inputs.
- In header you should show how many recipes are saved.
